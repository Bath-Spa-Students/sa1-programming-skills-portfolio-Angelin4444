# With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
# Print Apple as long as Apple is less than 10:

Apple = 1
while Apple < 10:
  print(Apple)
  Apple += 1  # Apple =Apple+1  


  count = 1
while count <= 5:
    print("Count is:", count)
    count += 1

#Infinite Loop With Break Statement 

Orange = 1
while Orange < 6:
  print(Orange)
  if Orange == 3:
    break
  Orange += 1   # Orange=Orange+1  Both are same
