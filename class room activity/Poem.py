#Poem No.1
#By Robert Frost
#Fire and Ice
print("""Some say the world will end in fire,
Some say in ice.
From what I've tasted of desire
I hold with those who favor fire.
But if it had to perish twice,
I think I know enough of hate
To say that for destruction ice
Is also great 
And would suffice """)

#Dust of Snow
print("""The way a crowshook down on me
The dust of snow
From a hemlock tree
Has given my heart
Achange of mood
And saved some part of a day I had rued.""")

#Devotion
print("""The heart can think of no devotion
Greater than being shore to the ocean--
Holding the curve of one position,
Counting an endless repetition.""")
